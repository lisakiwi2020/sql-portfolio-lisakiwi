## 🎙️ 1-Minute Walkthrough

“In this project, I used a multi-table relational database from a fictional bike store to simulate real-world business analytics. I imported the dataset into SQLite and wrote SQL queries to answer business questions such as top customers, best-selling products, monthly revenue trends, and store performance.

The goal was to demonstrate not just SQL syntax, but how to translate raw data into insights that would support marketing, operations, and sales decisions. I used joins, aggregations, and CTEs to uncover insights like revenue concentration among top customers and regional sales patterns.

All the work — including queries and schema documentation — is published on GitHub. It’s designed to reflect the type of analysis I would perform in a banking, retail, or digital business context.”
